// This rule does not apply to language constructs that have an effect that is

// Don't inline the function. This is used to mark cold functions for which
// inlining would be a waste of space and/or would make debugging inconvenient.

// Always inline the function. This is used for certain inline assembler
// wrappers which cannot safely be wrapped in a function call, such as
// load-exclusive instructions which might lose their exclusivity.
