// Only the memory block manipulation functions (mem*()) are declared. The

// manipulation functions (str*()) are left undefined.
//
// Note: MISRA Required Rule 21.2 states that reserved identifiers are not to
// be declared, and gives a memcpy declaration as a specific non-conforming
// example. However, the identifiers declared here (including memcpy) are
// _not_ reserved: the hypervisor is built in freestanding mode (as asserted
// below), which does not guarantee their presence and therefore must not give
// them special behaviour (see C18 clause 4, item 6). The Clang/GCC option
// -ffreestanding implies -fno-builtin for this reason.
//
// Also, we _must_ implement these functions ourselves with their standard
// semantics (regardless of MISRA 21.2) because the LLVM and GCC backends
// assume they are provided by the environment, and will generate calls to
// them even when the frontend is in freestanding mode.
